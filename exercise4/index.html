               <h2>Accessibility</h2>
               <p>Tab order is the order in which a user can utilize the tab key for navigating a site. It is an important part of accessibility
                  because not every user can easily use a mouse or touch pad for manuevering through a site. Tab order can easily be altered
                  through the use of tabindex.
               </p>
               <br>

"
                  (<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/">reference</a>). Following these guidelines can make the web more useful
                  for all people. It includes a wide variety of items such as color, captioning, text size and timing.

				<h3>Client Information</h3>

                <p>I will be making a website that is a portfolio of the recipes I eat on a plant-based diet.
                    This site will be an expansion of my instagram account and will be called Vegan 4 One</p>

               <h3>Development Process and Engagement</h3>

               <p>I am making this website for myself. I will do research into creating recipe nutrition.
                   I also hope to find a way to incorporate printable grocery lists. This will involve research more advanced ways to use
                   Javascript than I currently know.
                   Additionally, I will need to perform SEO keyword research. </p>

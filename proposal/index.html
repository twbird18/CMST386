			<h2>Proposal Information</h2>
			<section>
				<h3>Client Information</h3>

				<p>I will be making a website that is a portfolio of the recipes I eat on a plant-based diet. This site will be an expansion
					of my instagram account and will be called Vegan 4 One</p>

			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Development Process and Engagement</h3>

				<p>I am making this website for myself. I will do research into creating recipe nutrition. I also hope to find a way
					to incorporate printable grocery lists. This will involve research more advanced ways to use Javascript than I currently
					know. Additionally, I will need to perform SEO keyword research. </p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Testing</h3>

				<p>I will do code testing during the development process on several screen sizes as well as user testing. This will involve
					tracking code changes via github and inspecting the code using Chrome’s inspect function. Additionally, several individuals
					will be reviewing the site’s functionality. I will perform testing in Chrome and Firefox. If available, testing will
					also be performed in Safari.
				</p>

				<h3>Description</h3>

				<p>
					The goal of this business is to provide simple, cheap, plant-based recipes. The purpose of this website is to build a larger
					audience by showing how easy it is to make healthy food quickly and cheaply.
				</p>
				<p>This website is intended for individuals 25-40 yrs old, who are looking to cut their food costs and eat more healthily,
					but believe that cooking this way either takes too long or costs too much. Recent <a href="https://www.racked.com/2014/8/29/7578665/millennials-shopping-habits">studies</a>
					have shown that their shopping and cooking habits are different than previous generations.
				</p>

				<p>These individuals earn < $50K/year, have some post-secondary education, and predominantly live in cities. They are
					 more digitally connected than any other generation before them and get a lot of information via social media. They
					 also value <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/273191">user-generated content</a> more. These facts mean
						that it is important to create unique content for the site and to provide significant social media engagement. New
						posts will need to be shared across different forms of social media and the means to provide social shares will be
						provided.

				</p>

				<p>Photos, videos and recipes will be created by me for this site. Embedded twitter updates will be added from twitter,
					calorie counts will be provided from a source such as <a href="https://www.verywellfit.com/recipe-nutrition-analyzer-4157076">
						Very Well Fit</a> The sites content will be updated weekly.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Growth and Maintenance</h2>

				<p>It will continue to grow and evolve over time. Eventually, the site will have:</p>
				<ul class="evolution">
					<li>Comments</li>
					<li>Recommendations</li>
					<li>Cookbooks</li>
					<li>Recipe Selection for addition to a weekly grocery shopping list</li>
					<li>Search Engine</li>
					<li>Weekly Mailing List</li>

				</ul>
				<p>It's important to develop a good initial framework so that the site can be easily maintained as it grows and evolves.
					Content will need to be continuously created and new recipes and shopping lists will be developed weekly. </p>

			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Organization</h3>

				<p>The site will use a hierarchical structure, with a home page, recipes, about, and weekly meal prep shopping list.
					The recipe page will expand into breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snack pages. The most recent postings will be located
					on the home page in a carousel using something like the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_carousel.asp">
						bootstrap carousel plugin.</a> There will be a horizontal dropdown navigation bar on every page. </p>

				<p>Insert Layout & Wireframes here</p>
			</section>

			<section>

				<h3>Web Hosting</h3>

				<p>First, I will determine what my website needs are. I don’t expect a high amount of traffic to begin with and I won’t
					be using any type of site builder. I also won’t need a significant amount of storage space initially. I might need a
					content management system eventually. Then, it’s important to consider their customer support options, potential cancellation
					policy, and how easy it is to set-up and maintain the site. Finally, I would consider price, security, and server uptime.
				</p>

				<p>SSL will be necessary for future logins and commenting options. A content management system will be important in the
					future for managing recipe posts as more are added. This will require an investigation into whether a headless or hybrid
					CMS system is best for my uses.
				</p>
				<p>This site will use HTML5, CSS, and Javascript for now. </p>
				<p>Ideally, the site domain would be vegan4one.com, but that will require an aftermarket purchase so currently, the site will
					utilize vegan4one.org which I own. </p>
